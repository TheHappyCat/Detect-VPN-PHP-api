# Detect VPN PHP API

You will find here two PHP files that allow you to check if an IP address is a VPN / Proxy or a bad IP from a host for example. Thus, you can check this and retrieve information / details about an IP address from IPWarner's IP lookup technology.

The system is quite accurate and easily usable, the example here is in PHP, but you can implement it in any programming language that supports API requests. A free version of the API is available on IPWarner.  It is quite accurate and allows 1,000 requests per day, which is enough for tests. Paid offers are available to detect VPNs, so you can secure your company or business (game server, online store) from fraudsters or bots from this API. 

# PHP Proxy Detect

This API also allows you to retrieve IP address details: ASN (Autonoumous System Name), ISP (Internet Service Provider), country name, city name, longitude and latitude, details on the position of the IP address, host name, response time, who owns the IP address, whether the address is malicious, whether the IP address is a shared address on a VPS or a dedicated server and many other features are available from this API. 
This is easy to implement and I invite you to set up a cache over the requests in order to avoid being limited quickly and to recover the data more quickly to process them in real time with your website or application.

PHP code uses CURL technology that must be enabled on your server or with the php-curl library from your nginx or Apache server. This will allow you to make quick queries on the API so that you can use the system efficiently and without problems.

## Why this Detector API ?

I chose this API because it is the most powerful VPN detector on the market, and many companies use it. Unfortunately, it is not well enough known on the Internet, and I invite you to try it. Support is fast and offers are really cheap, with unbeatable quality.
